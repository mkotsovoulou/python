# Types

Recall that Python supports multiple "types," among them strings (aka `str`) and integers (aka `int`). Suffice it to say the type of a variable matters!

Consider the program in `types.py` in the text editor at top-right. At first glance, it looks like it

1. prompts the user for two inputs, `x` and `y`,
2. adds `x` and `y`, storing the sum in `z`, and
3. prints `z`.

But let's look more closely.

Type `python types.py` in the terminal window at bottom-right, followed by Enter. When prompted for `x`, input `1`, followed by Enter. When prompted for `y`, again input `1`, followed by Enter.

How curious!

Contrary to what this program thinks, 1 plus 1 does not equal 11! The sum should, of course, equal 2.

Modify `types.py` in the text editor at top-right in such a way that the program correctly outputs the sum of `x` and `y`.
