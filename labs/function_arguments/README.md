# Functions, Arguments

Recall that `print` is a "function" that's built into Python. Someone implemented that function long ago so that you don't need to worry about _how_ to print something on the screen; you just know _that_ you can do it.

Of course, that someone had no idea what you (or anyone) might want to print on the screen, and so `print` accepts one or more "arguments," inputs that tell it what, exactly, to print.

In `print.py` in the text editor at top-right, write a program that prints anything other than `hello, world`.

Recall that you can run (and therefore test) your program by running `python print.py` in the terminal window at bottom-right.
