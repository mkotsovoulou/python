# Loops

If you ever played Super Mario Bros. back in the day, you might recall this scene, wherein four question marks were hovering in the sky:

Let's recreate a bit of that game, albeit in text!

In `mario.py`, implement a program that prints, quite simply, `????`, without using a loop.

Elsewhere in Super Mario Bros., there might be more (or even fewer) than four question marks in the sky. Let's prepare for as much.

Modify `mario.py` in the text editor at top-right in such a way that the program prints, quite simply, `????`, this time using a loop to print each question mark one at a time, each on the same line.

{% spoiler Hint %}
To print a question mark without a newline (i.e., carriage return) after it, use

```
print("?", end="")
```

which appends `""` (i.e., the "empty string") to each question mark instead of, `"\n"` (which represents a newline), the default.

Indeed,

```
print("?")
```

is actually equivalent to

```
print("?", end="\n")
```

but is quicker to type!
{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}

Okay, your program still only prints four question marks, and somehow we've gone and made it more complicated nonetheless. But consider that just a step toward this final goal! (Boss level!)

Modify `mario.py` in the text editor at top-right in such a way that the program

1. prompts the user for a positive integer, and
2. prints that many question marks, all on the same line.


{% check %}
