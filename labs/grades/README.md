# TEMPERATURE CONVERSION
## General information
Create a script that extracts a °F temperature from a phrase, converts it in °C, and then displays the original phrase with the temperature °C, properly formatted. 
The phrase should be like the following example:
"Temperature in Athens is: 69 degrees °F"
Assume that the phrase has the format appearing above, so it contains 6 items, and the temperature value is always the 5th item
Your script should extract the original temperature, convert the temperature into C degrees, so that it can be reused in a European web site.
Print the converted text as: "Temperature in Athens is: 20.56 °C"
Format the output so that:
the temperature in C is rounded to 2 decimals.
the degrees symbol ° that appears before C is set with its ASCII code (176) - hint: use the chr() function

The program should work for any value in F degrees inside the original string - so after you write the script, change the value of degrees F in the original string and make sure that the program runs properly. Before you submit, change the value of the original text back to 69.

## Run your program to see if it compiles

```
python grades.py
```

Enter as input 99
and check that the output is A

Run your code again, now enter 5 as input and check that the output is F

Run your code once more and enter 102 as input and check that the output is Wrong grade

{% next %}
 
## Check your code, using the check tool
 
```
check50  mkotsovoulou/python/main/labs/grades
```

## Check the styling of your code, using the style tool
 
```
style50 grades.py
```

## Submit your work 

```
submit50  mkotsovoulou/python/main/labs/grades
```

DONE!
